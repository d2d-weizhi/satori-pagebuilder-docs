# Sprint 1.0: Laying the Groundwork for Docs Portal

**Date:** 2025-07-20

---

## 1. Scope / Context

- Establish the foundation for the Satori PageBuilder Documentation Portal.
- Define navigation structure, content categories, and API reference architecture.
- Begin seeding core API entities (block data, interfaces, types) and test relational DB schema.
- Set up initial branding and icon design for the docs UI.

---

## 2. What Was Accomplished

- Designed and exported a clean lotus-inspired Satori logo, finalized brand color palette.
- Brainstormed, drafted, and structured the core sidebar and main content layout for the docs portal.
- Defined the **API Reference** categories: Components, Interfaces, Props Interfaces, Types/Constants, Store Classes, Serialization/Deserialization.
- Set up the initial Postgres schema for entities, members, methods_funcs, versions, and related_entities.
- Seeded the database with key block data interfaces, including:
  - `IButtonBlockData`, `IDividerBlockData`, `IHeadingBlockData`, `ITextBlockData`, `IImageBlockData`, `ISlideImage`, `IHeroContent`, `ICallToAction`, `IHeroSlide`, `IHeroSliderBlockData`, `IVideoBlockData`, `SocialType`, `ISocialIconConfig`, `ISocialsBlockData`, `IHtmlBlockData`, `ContentBlockType`, `ContentBlockData`, `IContentBlock`, `IColumnsBlock`, `IDesignBlock`.
- Added serialization functions and their documentation for `ColumnsBlock`.
- Linked the first real UI component (`DesignBlock`) and its props in the reference system.

## 3. Observations / Lessons Learnt

- Planning content structure **before coding** pays off; saves rework.
- Itâ€™s critical to establish clear naming conventions (for slugs, categories, interface names) early on.
- Dollar-quoted strings (`$$ ... $$`) in Postgres are a lifesaver for storing code samples.
- Organizing types, constants, and interfaces as first-class API entities makes the docs much more robust and future-proof.
- Seeding a variety of categories up front makes UI testing much more realistic.

---

## 4. Dev Logs

- Confirmed new logo and brand palette, with lotus mark and blue-400 as primary accent.
- Confirmed DB schema flexibility; ready for batch seeding and possible automation.
- Noted that function-typed props are best treated as `members` in props interfaces, while true component/class methods can go in `methods_funcs`.
- Next.js app layout ready for sidebar + content area, version switcher, and search bar.
- Sufficient seed data for building the first version of the docs UI. Next step: iterate, test, and adjust before scaling up.
