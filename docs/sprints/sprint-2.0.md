## Session 2.1: Combining Seeded Data with API Reference Content (UI Testing)

**Date:** 2025-07-21

### 1. Scope/Content:

- Integrate PostgreSQL database with Next.js docs portal.
- Render and list all API reference entities on `/api-reference`.
- Create a dedicated “Interfaces” listing page.
- Build individual entity details pages using dynamic `[slug]` routes.
- Design and test a responsive, developer-friendly docs layout with a right sidebar for related entities.
- Implement helpers to fetch related entities and interface members.
- Ensure all text content (e.g., descriptions) safely decodes HTML entities.

### 2. What Was Accomplished:

- Successfully connected Neon PostgreSQL to Next.js using `@neondatabase/serverless`.
- Listed all entities on the API Reference page, each linking to its detail page.
- Created an “Interfaces” section that filters only interface-type entities.
- Implemented dynamic routing and strongly typed params for entity detail pages.
- Designed a wide, flexible, and clean two-column layout:
  - Main content is left-aligned and uses available screen width.
  - Right sidebar lists related entities, with links constructed using dynamic category-based paths.
- Added utility to normalize category names for SEO-friendly URLs.
- Rendered interface members as a modern, readable list (not just a table).
- Implemented a safe method (`he.decode()`) for displaying all descriptions with proper HTML entity decoding.
- Adopted Recursive as the monospace font for all code and identifier references.
- Layout and navigation now scale gracefully on any screen size or zoom factor.

### 3. Observations / Lessons Learnt:

- A clean, wide, and flexible docs layout greatly improves readability and developer experience.
- Handling edge cases for entity categories (spaces, slashes) early pays off when designing for future extensibility.
- Decoding HTML entities is essential for rendering seeded descriptions or code snippets correctly.
- Strongly typed params and helper functions simplify dynamic routing and future maintenance.
- Designing for “real dev usage” (using all screen space, readable code, easy navigation) makes a major difference in docs quality.
- Breaking features into focused, testable sprints (e.g. just interfaces first) reduces complexity and stress.

### 4. Dev Logs:

- Connected to Neon PostgreSQL with environment variables; verified connection.
- Built `/api-reference` to fetch and map all entities.
- Built `/api-reference/interface` and `/api-reference/interface/[slug]` with filtered lists and detail routing.
- Added helpers: getRelatedEntitiesForEntity, getMembersForEntity, and a kebab-case utility for category paths.
- Refined layout for two-column, responsive, margin-balanced UX.
- Tested various description data, including special HTML entities.
- Tweaked sidebar to display “See also” with links dynamically based on category and slug.
- Adopted Recursive font for all code/monospace elements.
- Confirmed that layout and content are robust on all screen sizes and zoom levels.
- Deferred MobX store/manager class seeding and advanced function/member integration to a future sprint.
- **Note for future Next.js/Vercel deploys:**
  Use inline typing for route params in dynamic `page.tsx` components (e.g. `{ params: { slug: string } }`) instead of custom interface types. Vercel expects the props to match the App Router’s convention, otherwise you’ll get a type constraint error and builds may fail.
